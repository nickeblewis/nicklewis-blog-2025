title: My future on the internet (working title)

I can remember the days of dial-up modems, of Compuserve, Fidonet and then the very early web, HTML 1.0, just text and links. I used to rack up some horrendous phone bills, which would drive my Dad nuts at times, I was a typical petulent teenager in those days and was addicted to this new world. I was excited to have an American pen-friend who lived in Florida (she still does and only spoke to her the other day) and how I could access vast encyclopaedias of knowledge online. Sure enough, most of this stuff would take an absolute age to weave it's way down the phoneline to my SCGA monitor, with it's pallete of 16 colours and a meagre amount of RAM. I stored everything on floppy disks and some data on its dinky little HD.
