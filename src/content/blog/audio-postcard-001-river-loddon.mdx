Welcome to the first in what I hope will be an ongoing series of Audio Postcards - brief sonic snapshots of places that have caught my ear and imagination.

## The River Loddon

The River Loddon winds its way through Hampshire and Berkshire, eventually joining the Thames near Reading. This recording was captured on a quiet morning where the river bends through woodland, creating a natural amphitheater of water sounds.

## Listening Notes

The gentle flow of water over stones creates a natural rhythm, punctuated by the occasional bird call and the rustle of leaves in the morning breeze. There's something meditative about standing by running water - it seems to wash away the noise of everyday life.

## About Audio Postcards

Audio Postcards are my attempt to capture and share the sonic character of places - from urban soundscapes to natural environments. Each one is a small sonic gift, a moment of pause in our busy lives.
