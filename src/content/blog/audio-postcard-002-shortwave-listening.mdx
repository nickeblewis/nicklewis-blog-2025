Welcome to the second in my _Audio Postcard_ series — brief sonic captures from unusual vantage points.

## About This Recording

This entry moves from riverside calm to radio static: a session of **shortwave listening**, recorded with a portable receiver as it drifted through amateur transmissions, number stations, and fading bursts of static melody. It’s an ode to the lingering mystery of the airwaves.

## Notes

There’s a meditative quality in tuning between voices — the liminal signals that flicker and vanish. Each fragment of sound is a postcard from an unseen place, carried by ionospheric currents instead of mail.

## Closing Thoughts

Shortwave soundscapes remind me how communication used to depend on mystery. Signals crossed oceans without certainty, and part of their charm is that they still do.
