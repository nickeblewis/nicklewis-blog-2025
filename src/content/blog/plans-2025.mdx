title: My plans for 2025
---

This year I plan to build more, to create at least one website, this one especially - that helps me explore the latest web technologies, to keep up with my peers. We all spend a lot of time online and I feel that I should start to move away from corporate platforms for blogging and forge my own. Rather than endlessly waste (harsh) time scrolling through Substack content etc, that time could be better sent engineering features for this site, to feed new found knowledge into the open source community.

I know of a few things I'd like to explore and some protocols, technologies that I'd love to integrate with this website but first I need to spec these out, what they are, why I wish to integrate them and how to go about it. What will the benefits be for doing so?

Let's jot down a few headers, that always helps encourage some form of momentum. I ended up writing a lot, clearly this is going to be another massive year for learning and exploration, which is awesome.

## Design some components

One of the main areas of interest that I have is in building components that can be used throughout my personal projects. They serve many purposes, such as boosting ones coding skills and can also be easily shared within the wider community. So here are some mini project ideas for the year ahead. I may or may not get to work on all of them but it's good ractice to write up ideas early each year, to see if you can pull them off.

### Build a music player

I was looking at web audio last month and the level of support within HTML for this and it's made me realise that it is not as simple as perhaps it could be.

### Build a youtube embed

## Map out what is happening in browser tech currently

I am primarily interested in learning more about Vue and Nuxt, I've started to build this website using these particular tools and it will evolve from here.

- Typescript
- Tailwind
- Vue 3 and Vue 4 isn't all that far off on the horizon either
- Same goes for Nuxt 3, as 4 is on it's way

## Learn and track

## Share ideas through open source

## Learning beyond the front-end

### Artificial Intelligence

AI is something I've not mentioned until now and it is something that I do have an interest in but not particularly expert in either. LLMs are the buzzword of our times and I reckon it would be worth building at least one, it might help in various ways.

There are a lot of interesting services

## Music

## Photography

## Local history
