First of all have you seen the very brilliant website/app called [Samply](https://samply.app)? It's brilliant and I am trying the free version at the moment. I am also a SoundCloud user and love the community over there too. There is also Wavlake for the v4v audience - all of which I shall dedicate posts to in the future.

The above track was created using the iPad, which has become my goto tool for composing and doing a lot of explorative jamming on. AUM is a superb host app from which you can load AUv3 plugins into, link it up with MIDI devices, software or hardware, creating a superb music workstation. It has the advantages of being portable, having a touch screen, that not all apps make great use of but most do. It's downsides are mainly just having the one USB port or if you have an older iPad a lightning port, for which you need dongles etc. That said, when paired up with an audio interface such as the Minifuse 4, it works like a charm.

## The Plugins used

### DynaBit

I have been beta testing DynaBit recently, a new audio effect from Caelum Audio. You may still be able to join the testing via TestFlight [https://testflight.apple.com/join/stpSNDWb](https://testflight.apple.com/join/stpSNDWb) but it depends when you read this, it might have been released by that time!

What is it exactly?

It's a bit reduction effect that lets you process audio by first filtering the incoming signal, then reducing it's sample rate, followed by bit reduction and has a beat repeat module on top of that. On top of all of this, you can also modulate the parameters through a built in LFO and Sequencer. The built in Visualiser, provides you with excellent feedback.

### StepPolyArp

This plugin isn't new but has just had a huge update. It was already very good but now it is amazingly good. It's a sequencer and arpeggiator in one. What I love about it the most, is that it's very jammable.

## Recording and sharing

I record within AUM and the files are written into my AudioShare folder. So I literally find the file on my iPad, share it directly to the Samply app, grab the embed code and paste into my blog post.
