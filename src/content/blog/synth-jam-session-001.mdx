Welcome to the first in what will become an ongoing series of synth jam sessions - spontaneous electronic explorations captured in the moment.

## About This Session

This jam session was an experiment in hybrid setups, that is to say the use of an iPad Pro running AUM, connected to a Zoom Livetrak L6 with a MIDI and audio connection to a hardware synth, in this instance a Roland S1. Recorded using Audacity and hosted on audio.com, this represents my exploration of both new sonic territories and new platforms for sharing audio content.

## Gear & Setup

I recently bought a Zoom L6 and this forms the heart of my hybrid setup. It's basically DAWless because I am not using any linear software in my compositions, my music is more reactive, perhaps more live in a sense, tweaking MIDI patterns on the go, creating interesting "happenings" as I like to call them. The iPad is connected via USB to the Zoom, and I have connected that to the Roland S1, via TRS cables and a MIDI connection. The sequencer running on the iPad links to the Roland.

## Notes on the Jam

This session explores melodies in the A minor scale, along with industrial and mechanical sounding drum rythyms. The improvised nature means it goes through various phases - from gentla harmonies to abrasive techno led patterns.

## About My audio.com Experiment

I'm currently experimenting with audio.com as a platform for hosting and sharing my audio content. What appeals to me about audio.com is its seamless integration with Audacity - you can upload directly from the app, which streamlines the workflow from creation to sharing. As they put it, it's "a better way to upload and share audio online."

The platform seems particularly well-suited for experimental and ambient music, with a community that appreciates more adventurous audio content.

## More Synth Jams

This is the first in what I plan to be a regular series. Each session will be a snapshot of a moment in time - no overdubs, no corrections, just pure musical exploration.
