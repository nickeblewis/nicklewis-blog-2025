Welcome to **Synth Jam Session 002**, an improvised and semi‑random exploration of polygonal synthesis and procedural modulation. Unlike the previous session, this one was composed using an experimental generative sequencer patched through virtual modular instruments.

## About This Session

This jam leaned heavily into chance operations. Every modulation source was set to drift unpredictably, forcing the mix into unexpected collisions of tone and texture. Recorded in real time using Logic Pro, it demonstrates how unpredictability can sometimes sound cohesive.

**Session Details:**

- **Duration**: 27 minutes, generative flowing textures
- **Recorded**: 2 Feb 2026
- **Equipment**: Mac + Logic Pro + modular plug‑ins (Vult, PhasePlant, Vital)
- **DAW**: Logic Pro
- **Platform**: audio.com

## Gear & Setup

The system used a virtual modular grid hosted in AUM (yes, again on iPad), with random voltage generators modulating filters and oscillators. MIDI‑to‑CV mapping converted gestures from a Launchpad Pro into gate signals that triggered pattern shifts.

## Notes on the Jam

The tone palette oscillates between glitchy drone clouds and bell‑like harmonics. Occasionally, algorithmic randomness produces unexpected rhythmic grooves that seem almost intentional — the beauty of chaos harnessed.

## Closing Thoughts

Every jam teaches something about surrendering control. This one reminded me that sometimes letting the machines talk amongst themselves produces the most human results.
